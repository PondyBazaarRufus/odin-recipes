            <h2>What's aloo baingan?</h2>
            <p> Aloo baingan is a wholesome and delicious vegetarian dish made from potatoes <i>(aloo)</i>, eggplants <i> (baingan)</i>, tomatoes and lots of spices. Eaten with hot steamed rice or fresh bread, it's like a warm hug on a crisp fall day.  </p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>So, this is what you're going to need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> One medium Japanese eggplant, cut into 1" pieces </li>
                <li> One small russet potato, peeled and cut into 1" pieces</li>
                <li> Half a cup of finely chopped red onions</li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
                <li> A piece of ginger, about 1" long</li>
                <li> One mild green chilli</li>
                <li> 4-5 plump garlic pods</li>
                <li> 1 large tomato </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon each of turmeric, chilli and coriander powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of cumin powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon crushed dried fenugreek leaves <i>(kasoori methi)</i></li>
                <li> Salt, to taste</li>
                <li> 4 tablespoons Canola oil</li>
                <li> 1 tablespoon finely chopped coriander leaves</li>
            </ul>
            <h2> How to put it together</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Heat the oil in a wok and add cumin seeds. Wait for them to sizzle. In the meantime, pound the garlic, ginger and green chilli to a rough paste in a mortar and pestle.</li>
                <li> Add the ginger-garlic-chilli paste to the wok and stir for a couple of minutes over medium-high heat. Now add the onions and stir until they are translucent. Add salt.</li>
                <li> Add the chopped tomato and stir for a few minutes. Then add chilli, coriander and turmeric powders and mix. When the tomatoes have softened and the oil has separated from the mix, add the chopped potato and eggplant and mix in thoroughly with the sauce.</li>
                <li> Cover and let cook for about 10 minutes.</li>
                <li> Give it a good stir after 10 minutes, add a little water and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Cover again until done (another 10 minutes) over low heat.</li>
                <li> Open, add the cumin powder and crushed fenugreek seeds and stir. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve with rice or bread. </li>
            
            </ol>
