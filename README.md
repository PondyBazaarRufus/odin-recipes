This is a basic recipes website. 

The skills I hope to demonstrate are: 
1. HTML basics, the boilerplate and the basic elements of a page. 
2. Lists, unordered and ordered. 
3. Links, both absolute and relative. 
4. Some Git and GitHub skills. 
5. Practicing making commits and writing some decent commit messages.
